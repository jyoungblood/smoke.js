Notify or get approval from your users quickly and with style. This alert system uses css animations and background (so there are no images or js animation code...so it's really lightweight).

It's easy to implement and really easy to change the style.

Take a look at the demo: [http://ssssnakes.com/smoke/](http://ssssnakes.com/smoke/).




Supported Browsers
------------------
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- IE 6+ (usable, no animation [whatevs], visual IE6 support [transparencies, etc] is up to you)
- iOS Mobile Safari

(widespread mobile support [android, blackberry, windows] uncertain)

Current User Notices
---------------------
-If any of your custom css depends on #smoke-out (like the original themes did), you'll need to change it to .smoke-base. Similarly, any #smoke-bg dependencies need to change to .smokebg.



Planned Updates
---------------
-Logic to support stacking alert (and possibly signal) dialogs better (show in the right order, one at a time)
	-errors in ie 7-8 :(
	
-Get webkit outbound transitions working properly again

-Uniform callback implementation for everything (it's currently being done a little differently for prompt/confirm() and alert())
